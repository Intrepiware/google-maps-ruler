{"name":"Google-maps-ruler","tagline":"A small JavaScript library to allow users to measure distance between multiple points on Google Maps.","body":"Ruler of Google Maps\r\n=================\r\n\r\n`google-maps-ruler` is a small JavaScript library to allow users to measure distance between points on Google Maps.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n\r\n## Bower\r\n\r\nUse `bower install google-maps-ruler` to install this package.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nDownload from GitHub and include `dist/google-maps-ruler.js` or `dist/google-maps-ruler.min.js` in your app.\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\n`google-maps-ruler` uses [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), so it works in CommonJS, AMD and browser environments. For example, if the JavaScript file is included using `<script>` directly, it exposes a global object `gmruler`.\r\n\r\n`gmruler` requires a `google.maps.Map` object to work with. After `google.maps.Map` is created, use `gmruler.init` to initialize.\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\ngmruler.init(map, {\r\n  distanceUnit: 'mile'\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## User interactions\r\n\r\nAfter `google-maps-ruler` is initialized on the map, following user interactions are supported:\r\n\r\n* Right click to add a new point.\r\n* Double-click on a point to remove it.\r\n* Drag the point label to change its position.\r\n\r\n## Configurations\r\n\r\nThe second argument of `gmruler.init` function is an simple object for configuration. Configurations supported are:\r\n\r\n* `strokeColor` - Color of the polyline connecting points, e.g. `#ff0000`.\r\n* `strokeWeight` - Weight of the polyline connecting points, e.g. `2`.\r\n* `distanceUnit` - Unit for distance, can be `mile` or `km`. `km` is the default value.\r\n\r\n## Samples\r\n\r\nRefer to `sample` folder for some examples.\r\n\r\n# Customisations\r\n\r\n## Style\r\n\r\nUpdate CSS style `gmruler-label`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
